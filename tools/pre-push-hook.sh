# Agent Context Freshness Check — advisory pre-push hook
#
# Install: cp this file to .git/hooks/pre-push && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
# Or: add to your pre-push hook chain via pre-commit framework
#
# This hook warns (never blocks) when context-relevant code was modified
# but agent-context artifacts were not updated in the commits being pushed.
#
# Prerequisite:
#   copy scripts/check_freshness.sh -> .agent-context/tools/check_freshness.sh
#
# Customize CONTEXT_RELEVANT_PATHS to match your repo structure.
